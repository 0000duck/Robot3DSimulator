# Robot3DSimulator
This repository contains the simulation of several Robot3D of 6DOF.
The utilized programming is C# WPF and Helix3D Toolkit is used for 3D Visualization of Robot Motion.
The aim of this project is as follows:
1. Implement the forward kinematics and inverse kinematics of 6DOF Robot.
2. Implement the motion path planning of robot and automate the motion.
3. Implement several functions to add the mathematical curves including Bezier, Spline and other curve shapes, which are widely used for industrial robots.
4. Implement tracking of the tool(camera)
5. Implement simulation solely or combined with the real robot.

Perspective of this project:
This project is expanding for further usage.


All source and executable are ready and if any help, we will be so appreciated if let us know.
